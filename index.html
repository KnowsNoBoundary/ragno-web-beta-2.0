			This name is something that took me a while to
            come up with... because I like to create meaningful 
            names, such as this one. RAGNO means spider in 
            Italian, and I thought it was cool to have an 
            animal mascot such as a spider. I was also 
            thinking on making a "Special Elite Team" 
            such as DELTA Force! To those who are not 
            aware of DELTA Force, it's a Special Elite 
            Team that the USA has in hold for Special OPs. 
            Which is cool if you ask me! The other part 
            that I am proud of this name is the first 2 
            letters "RA". It's an Egyptian Sun God, and 
            that's pretty cool as well. The last reason 
            for me being proud of such name is, keeping 
            the name in all caps, because of abbreviations! 
            I haven't found one that we can use, but in 
            time, I am sure I will find one! I could also 
            just keep it like that, because RAGNO will not be
            a one game only. Therefore, the acronym for a
            specific game, will be different for another
            game. Anyways, that's all and I hope you can 
            be proud of this name as well!
